    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ramyeon, also known as ramen, is a popular Korean dish that has gained international recognition for its delicious flavors and satisfying qualities. It is a type of instant noodle soup that offers a delightful blend of textures and aromas. The foundation of ramyeon lies in its noodles, typically made from wheat flour and water, which are then kneaded, rolled, and cut into thin strands. These noodles have a distinct springy texture that adds a delightful chewiness to each bite. The soup is often prepared by mixing a flavoring powder with boiling water, resulting in a savory and aromatic broth that serves as the base for the dish. Ramyeon comes in a variety of flavors, such as spicy, seafood, chicken, and vegetable, catering to different taste preferences. It is commonly garnished with toppings like sliced green onions, bean sprouts, boiled eggs, and kimchi, further enhancing the overall taste and presentation.
