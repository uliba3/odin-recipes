    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a delectable Italian dish that boasts a rich and comforting allure. This culinary masterpiece is crafted by layering thin sheets of pasta with a savory amalgamation of ingredients. The foundation of lasagna lies in its tender pasta sheets, cooked to perfection, providing a delightful texture with each bite. Generously spread between the pasta layers is a luscious symphony of flavors, typically featuring a hearty meat sauce, velvety béchamel sauce, and a medley of cheeses. The meat sauce, often composed of ground beef, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and aromatic herbs, lends a robust and savory essence. The béchamel sauce, made from butter, flour, and milk, adds a creamy and velvety smoothness that envelops the layers. Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses grace the top, forming a golden and gooey crust when baked. The melding of these components creates a harmonious fusion of flavors, each stratum contributing its own distinct essence. The lasagna is then baked to perfection, allowing the flavors to meld together while the cheese melts and forms a tempting crust. The result is a decadent, multi-layered delight that is both satisfying and comforting, evoking feelings of warmth and homeliness. Whether enjoyed as a family dinner or a celebratory feast, lasagna captivates the senses and leaves an indelible mark on the palate.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions, adding salt to the boiling water for flavor. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the meat sauce:
          <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef (or a combination of ground beef and Italian sausage) to the skillet. Cook until browned and fully cooked, breaking it up into crumbles.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, chopped basil leaves, chopped oregano leaves, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Adjust seasonings if needed.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the béchamel sauce:
          <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Gradually whisk in all-purpose flour until well combined.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in milk while continuously whisking to avoid lumps. Keep whisking until the sauce thickens and comes to a gentle boil.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg (optional) for added flavor. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature according to the lasagna noodle package instructions.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna:
          <ol>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the meat sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce, and then a layer of the cheese mixture (ricotta, mozzarella, Parmesan, and parsley).</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce and cheese mixture on top.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on the top layer for a cheesy crust.</li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna in the preheated oven for the recommended time, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the lasagna is heated through.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice and serve.</li>
